These vacancies are either not yet involved in an active match, or the match has not progressed to a stage that would be disruptive if it were canceled, such as #{_("#{_('DND')} Initial Review")}.  Activating a match on a vacancy below will cancel any match involving the vacancy returning the matched client into the pool of available clients. It will not cancel other matches involving #{@client.full_name}.
