# Help, containers aren't running or are pending forever

  Things are broken, and you're panicking. Here are some things to try


  Log into AWS..

    * click on the service with problems
    * check events
    * check tasks. If you see none, try filtering to stopped tasks.

  ssh to EC2 instances and

    * sudo systemctl restart ecs

    * docker container ls, and docker stop problematic containers. We have a long
     stop time policy, and stuck containers, even of an unrelated type can cause
     problems.

    * run the update_agents.rb script from your laptop

    * check min and max healthly task definition parameters. ECS can get
      confused and deadlocked if they make for an impossible deployment

    * sudo systemctl start docker

    * sudo systemctl restart docker

    * reboot cluster server


# Can't build

    * If you get errors like: failed to export image: failed to create image: failed to get layer sha256:d4f636367bc5324f78075f817666c33561a97bc61328b08caddfa7957f2352df: layer does not exist
      try adding `RUN true` lines around the problematic Dockerfile line.
